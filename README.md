# Overview

This programming exercise will help you practice basic Java OO programming
and basic data structures. 

Start by looking in the edu.vanderbilt.cs.oo.Node interface. You will need 
to complete the instructions in this class and get the NodeTest to compile 
and pass. 

## Running the Tests

The tests for the assignment are contained in the edu.vanderbilt.cs.oo.NodeTest
class. You can run this class as a JUnit test in your IDE or from the 
command line using "gradle test". Every time that you commit and push
to GitHub, GitHub Actions will compile and test your code. You can 
view the results on the "Actions" tab in your GitHub repository.
